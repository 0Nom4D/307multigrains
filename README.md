### Prerequisites

To use this project, you'll need Python (Version 3.8) and Pytest for Unit Tests:

* [Python Installation](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Pytest Installation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/getting-started.html#install-pytest)

### Building program

307multigrains is a B-MAT-500 EPITECH module project.

307multigrains is about optimizing revenues though grains' price.

You can use this program as it follows:

```textmate
$> ./307multigrains -h
USAGE
    ./307multigrains n1 n2 n3 n4 po pw pc pb ps

DESCRIPTION
    n1  number of tons of fertilizer F1
    n2  number of tons of fertilizer F2
    n3  number of tons of fertilizer F3
    n4  number of tons of fertilizer F4
    po  price of one unit of oat
    pw  price of one unit of wheat
    pc  price of one unit of corn
    pb  price of one unit of barley
    ps  price of one unit of soy
```

You can also launch unit tests by using the command below at root of the repository:

```textmate
$> coverage run --rcfile=.coveragerc -m --source=sources/ pytest --capture=sys -rA tests/
